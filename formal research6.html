			<h1>Pricing</h1>
			<p> After those concepts on shaping the product, final essential step is to have an investigation in the market. For most consumers, they always want to use fewer prices to buy the same products. Knowing the market well leads to more profits.</p>
			<p> Finally, it turns to pricing. After the previous steps, "The product is expected to reach a high market penetration with a large cross-section of income classes, and the total cost of product usage may be perceived as significant, the pricing issue is of considerable importance." (Arora, 2006) One of the pricing goals is to present a high value to consumers. The ways to determine the price may be countless. Here mentioned one of the methods: framing" the price for a relatively large overall cost into a seemingly small daily usage cost." which means that utilize the approximate cost over a certain time interval divided by the time. So that you get "cost per time/day". And you can get your price in other standards. According to the professor, furthermore, in different time interval throughout the year, the price level may be fluctuated by some exterior reasons, such as the quantity demand and supply in winter or summer, festivals, and discount week. Through this concept, in discount weeks or festival, the price can be lower but small profits could lead to quick turnover. "The price of the product is determined by the market." said by Professor Martin. </p>
			<p> These are some of the basic information on how to finish a successful project positioning. If you follow this prescribed research paper step by step, it would make some sense on how to adjust a product, on your own. For suggestions on the product positioning, personally include the concepts into 5 points. To summarize, firming the target, analyzing the place condition you would sale in, shaping the brand, defined the competitors, and marketing strategies. </p>
