		      <p>   Human needs fancy lives to go through decades of life. </p>
		      <p>   Woman, who is afraid of thirty years old, would start to regret about their youth when it’s too late to correct. I’ve seen these YouTube videos for many times. Among them, there are few of them are rejoice and satisfied with their past thirty years. They fight for their own target. They make applauses for themselves. They may be confused by unseeing clouds on their forward roads. They may experience the sunshine after cloudburst. Overview my dreams, they paint an unsystematic scrawl. </p>
              <p>   First of all, I started with a red sunflower dream, through the time period of loving simulating others. Like most of the children, I want to stand on the stage and have speeches to a whole class of kids. Without doubt, my goal is to be an amiable teacher. This is a way to build my prestige and let me have the chance to take charge of a group of students. Because when I was in primary school, I use firm eyesight to stare at the teacher.  Whatever she said, I choose to believe. She’s the one who has more knowledge than my parents. More convincingly, she has the right to make red crosses on my book. What would that feeling like when children revere me, I wonder. </p>
              <p>   In high school, I started off with my new white cotton candy dream. That’s 2010, Shanghai Expo. I took a travel on a 4-Dimension machine in to the sky like I was really flying the airplane. The sense of overlooking the giant world, seeing them changed into tiny spots. The world can be under charge of me. That’s extremely impressive. One day, I can fly my plane to work or travel. That would be fun. However, I’m myopic. In this case, I don’t have the chance to be a pilot. </p>
              <p>   Without doubt, I had a new purple lavender dream after years of years finishing my adorable birthday cakes. As a normal people, I aimed to have both leisure and wage. “I need to store tons of money for my bank account in the future!” That’s my thoughts when I’m in Grade 11. At that time I know that in order to earn money, I should learn the foundations on Economics and be highly awarded of social events. Knowing the structure of the world do helps me with my dream come true. I start to get involved into all the trifles about money around me. </p>
              <p>   It’s quite common that we have to interact with parents, sometimes economics issues. We never have enough hindsight experience to have discussion with the elders. That’s why, at the end of an agreement, I was always the loser. They usually sent me back to the room and slammed the door. However, because of that, it enhanced my curiosity. </p>
              <p>   After all, we are too young to know the truth. I had really been eager to solve the most significant question around me for years: the loan. It’s reasonable and acceptable that they took loan to buy houses. However, it wasn’t unfathomed that when they earned money from business, they didn’t pay loan back in order to get rid of brutal interests. Just imagine, up to fifty percent of interest can save so much money to do more memorable investments. I complained all the time like an adult and reminded them to pay the money back. I can’t stand an affordable and useless house cost us such huge interests, up to half of the loan, in about a decade of year. And we already had place to live. I used to have “conversations” with mom very often, until the last time, my mom yelled at me and warned me to forget about loan. “It’s none of your business!” </p>
              <p>   Now I am eighteen years old, just reach the grown-up age. Since time passes, the society has changed. Recently were the tough years for China and the World. The financial crisis, the several times of earthquake…The world has to take time to recover the damage it got and healing itself. Thus citizens can get rid of inflation and shortage. Some of the rare resources may disappear through years and natural disasters. In the mean time, I took economics class in high school, so I’ve learned some of the concepts of distribution of scare sources. </p>
              <p>   Then my own perspectives changed. When we learned about trades and interests, I was pulled back to childhood, disputing about whether my parents should pay back loan as soon as they have their wage each month or every two month. To begin, we have to interpret the “economy” outside. In these years, the price of residents is rising rapidly. In other words, due to the decision my parents made several years ago, we actually earn lots of money from the resident, as long as we sale it in the right time. Once I was talked about the issue with my mom again and she finally explained the reasons. I needed to find answers by myself before they tell me their answer. Based on the knowledge and social experience I had, I find out that loan sometimes is another way to say gain. The huge bunch of interest can be measured as the opportunity cost. After all, nowadays, lands are the scarcities. And they are always considering making the money they had as valuable as it can be. My point of view through the loan is quit narrow that I just focus on the money at present instead of macroscopically and systematically before. </p>		  
              <p>   Among this issue, I realized that we should look through the essence of object and try to find what it will be after years. Although it’s hard to alter one’s subjective opinion, we can make examples to show them how vital it is to think wide. Recognizing in long-term, we can find more the present transient profits. And that’s also I found Business enjoyable. </p>
              <p>   A journey of one thousand miles begins with one step. So, I applied for Business college and accounting major in university to realize my dream. Choosing Accounting is because that it discuss the essential concept in finance and teach me to make better benefit-cost analysis. To answer my loan question, I start with Accounting. </p>
