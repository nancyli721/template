			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>  Each woman in the past should face limited public role. A woman should obey all the rules from her husband, regarding as the town manager. Since they were born, they do not need to be educated, because they were in the lower class. Their everyday life was boring and nothing new. They don’t have the right to discuss political issues with husbands. Among the production line, you can’t find any back of a woman. By reviewing the woman's status in history, we can know how lamentable they are. </p>
			<p>What rescued women is the publishing of the word “feminism”. Feminism is oppression towards the unfair treatments. It’s authoritative enough to reorganise society, so that the self-recognition and self- rescued of women can be preceded over imperialism, and dictatorship. According to the definition from “Merriam-Webster”, feminism represents “the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities”[4] No matter how women had suffered the unfair treatment in the past, their future started to change from 1848, in US, New York, South America. In 1848, for the first time, a group of women gathered together. After numerous debates, they signed up a Declaration of Sentiments, on the conference, which was an outline of the unfairness they got and the compensation they declared for themselves, with men. Thus, the Women Movement was launched. Otherwise, the first industrial revolution is the best chance for women to alter their social status. From then on, women can be educated and had chances to work and earn money, living independently. I will talk through the change of women status in 3 aspects: Education level, labor force or work, and political status.</p>
