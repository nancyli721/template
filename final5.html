			     <h1> Writing Techniques-analyzing- logic- evidence</h1>
			     
				 <p>If we announce the theme as the heart of the essay, then language and expression are definitely the body of the whole essay. It matters how you express or interpret yourself to readers. </p>
				 <p>Draw the essay instead of describing the features. As a matter of fact, the article should be well-organized and concise enough to win more readers, or practically, a higher score. First of all, writer should build his/her own vocabulary bank. This may not as hard to native English speaker as those international speakers. However, for your personal advantage, a vast vocabulary bank is quite beneficial in WRA 110 class writings. “She’s pretty” “Her hair was a rich shade of mahogany. It flowed in waves to adorn her glowing, porcelain-like skin. Her eyes, framed by long lashes, were a bright, emerald-green and seemed to brighten the world. A straight nose, full lips - she seemed the picture of perfection. Had she smiled, the world would sigh with contentment.  Had she laughed, the world would laugh with her. And had she wept, the whole world would want to comfort her.” (Tonya) Which one of these two sentences is more appealing to you? Certainly, the second one does a more exquisite job on describe the appearance of a girl. This is one of the suggestions you can use in any of your descriptive language, such as “Lived experience project”. </p>
				 <p>Furthermore, in the essay, try to use a specific sequence to help the texture of the whole essay. Comparing to a coherent story line, messy sentences will confuse the readers. Some of the frequently-used sequences could be logical, special, chronological orders. The logical order from the question to answer, then the explanation, is more approach to people’s daily conversation, so that it makes simple and clear. </p>
                 <p>Finally, abundant evidences and quotes are the elements make the reader trust what you are saying. Everything you said in the essay should be provable. This is why a formal writing differs from normal original composition. Ever in synthesis and literature essay writings. Moreover, sometimes, evidence or a visual example could actually touch up your essay as the same function of the visual descriptions. That can connects reader’s mind to concrete events to keep in mind and recall later. What you should do is use as many as evidence as you can and list all the reference at the end of the essay.</p>
				 <p>Overall, an enchanting article with furnished evidences could enhance your essay’s reliability and attractive more readers. In the rest of the part, it will show you how to quote correctly. </p>
