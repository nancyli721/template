			     <h1> Forehead: Writing purpose and themes- APA style/MPA style </h1>
			     
				 <p>A writer may have motivations which he or she is aware of, or have the thought to make an announcement or a report. For instance, for the first project you would have in this class in lived experience. This essay will help you to form your identity and get to know yourself, so that it comes out why you are studying in that major. In general, people’s writing purposes can be concluded into: reflection, announcement, literacy, participation. After knowing your writing purpose, then you can have the motivation to do the project, in other words, forming the theme of the project. Theme is the core of the article. Basically, the whole essay are discussing based on the theme. It’s determined by the requirements and instructions from the instructor. For example, the cultural experience project required us to write an essay to record a social issue, consequently reflex the cultural differences behind the issue. As for me, I found a social event wrote on the core concept of a Japanese artist, which is feminism. Owning to this artist’s animation style, I decide my essay’s theme as women’s social status from before to present. In the whole, the essay revolves around the theme as a whole. </p>
				 <p>Furthermore, due to this is formal college writing, the format is another vital matter to remember. You should write the whole essay in APA style or MLA style. You can always check more information on “Purdue OWL”. ("Purdue owl," ) Though it’s a bit complicated for freshman to transfer from casual essay writing to those formal styles, it’s proved that these formats can help you explain the concept as distinct as possible and facilitates reading comprehension as well as find the references.</p>
