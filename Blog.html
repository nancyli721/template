			<h1>Blog:Inclass Activity: Youtube Video- The man's self report</h1>
			  <p>  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYa0wi4XzeI </p>
			  <p>  The presenter of this video posted this video in order to state one of his beliefs through a five-year letter to his dear uncle: everything will get better and be fulfilled with hope as time passed and live actively. In the beginning of the video, there are words pictured from blackboard to generally summarize the intimate links between the presenter and his uncle. Through the speech, his main purpose was to mourn his uncle. Basically, it’s a letter to his uncle. Besides that, in the first part of the letter, the presenter introduced both his and his uncle’s paths, narrating his essential events happened on him. Afterwards, he expressed his tremendous painful feeling when he had to face his uncle’s sudden death. It was more like a reflection of himself, on his deep admiration to uncle and his helplessness when he was alone. However, “it gets better”. For the last part of the speech, audience are told that after few years of teaching, sinking in literature and philosophy and normal life time, things get better. He tried to express the belief that keep living and trying, everything will get better and fulfil with hope. </p>
			  <p>  The video attempts to achieve the purpose mainly through pathos. The voice and tone, the expression ways and the choice of words, a bunch of rhetoric methods all support the emotional appeal. First of all, through the speech, his voice changed from calm to arousing, even choke, every now and then. It helped to agitate audience’s mood. Besides that, the presenter chose vivid and concrete language and words. He utilized a bunch of figurative words that are emotionally charged to describe his precise feeling in great detail. Moreover, the parallel construction of a series of synonyms likes bullets shooting on you. And the rhetoric questions made a great emotional impact which engage audience to be connected and agreed with his main propose as well. </p>
			  <p>  Through this video, the concrete structure shows that a good structure helps to connect readers with the words. In order to engage their attention, I need to be careful on choosing vivid words and figurative language to actually show my experience instead of describing them. Because this essay ought to need clear logical relation, I need to pay more attention on the consecution of the whole story line to improve my essay. </p>
		    <h1>Blog: Inclass Activity: The Social Network </h1>
			  <p> Nowadays, it’s the area of informational tech-knowledge. We seldom chat with each other through phone calls or mails, instead, we just shoot someone on Facebook and Twitter, as a response, other person would reply us as soon as possible. Thank for the invention of social networking. In the movie “The Social Network”, it narrated the invention of facebook and it’s founder, Mark. He was firstly inspired by his ex-girlfriend to write blogs and setup girls’ competition over the internet. This came out the first version of Facebook. Though that kind of reaction is rude and impolite, it’s his way to lead off his anger. Facebook should be designed to communicate instead to discriminate people. In modern world, especially the women’s social status has been improved a lot, unlike the status hundred years ago. Thus, we can’t point at woman to complain. Overall, thanks to Facebook, it makes better life! </p>
			
			<h1>Blog: Inclass Activity: Eminem Chrysler Commercial </h1>
			  <p>    In today’s class, we watched a commercial to help us learn more about the remix. Well, in this commercial, it was acted by my favorite rapper “Eminem”. How excited! It basically showed the transaction from decline to flourish between recession periods of Detroit City. First, the film showed the positive view of the City, like Fox Theatre, the man made ice rink. Over the years of being full of crimes, it clearly showed the unfortunate of that city and citizens. Furthermore, with the song “Lose yourself” be Eminem, and linked to his past personal events, both city and Eminem show how the react to recession positively. Everything will be OK. In my personal view, the central theme of this commercial is to show how much a strong determination could change the world. If a city decided to be prosperous in short time, doing whatever they could and try hard could realize the dream. For person, so shall is be.</p>

			<p>  Ok, this is my first week in MSU. It’s the start of College life as a freshman. I could never thought of being a freshman before 2months, the time I graduated from high school. I’ve been always prepared for my college since grade 9. As an international student, I should have my IBT test and SAT. It’s definitely a long time of preparing. However, about living, I’ve never thought about before. As soon as leaving my hometown, I found it’s really hard for me to say: I’m fine, or I’ll be fine. There would be so many people to miss about. However, when I came here, everything seems lighter. I know I’ll have great life in this place for the next four years! Fighting!</p>
			<h1>Blog#2</h1>
			<p>  I regard the real happiness of human being as success. No matter which kind of happiness, when you own it, you are successful. Let me give an example. Last week, I saw Breakfast at Tiffany. In the movie, Audrey says that she cannot accept George‘s love, because love is cage, no one belong with anyone. George is very indignant about Audrey, he says: “People do fall in love; people do belong with each other. Because that is the only chance anybody’s got for real happiness.” And then he gets off the taxi and walk into the rain. Audrey is very sad, and when she wears the ring George gives her, she understands the words he says. Hence, Audrey runs into the rain and catches up George. In the end, two lovers hug each other and kiss. After the movie over, I thought about that sentence about happiness again. No matter how rich, how powerful a person is, if he doesn’t feel happy, all his wealthy and power is no meaning. How can he be regarded as a successful man? In the movie, George uses his own power to move the girl he loves, and he works hard for her. Even though he is a poor writer, he has been a successful person.</p>
			<h1>Blog#3</h1>
			<p>  This is my first try in writing an essay with greater than 1000. In high school, I was kind of good at writing. In the last year, we focus on synthesis writing and response to literature. At that time, I was really tired of read and analyze a poem and writing a response essay. However, after learned the strategies and practicing. I start t good at these kind of writing. However, from now on I have to get used to another kind of writing, paper in APA or MLA style. I’ll try to be good at it as I did a year ago!</p>

			<p>  I start to know what’s coding doing at this time! I really enjoy the tutorial step by step. Though I won’t have to take this coding class in the major, I’m really glad that I can have the chance to learn coding. When I see the subtle things change on my website, I feel that’s how amazing and incredible. I believe, my page will be better as I go through the tutorial!</p>
			<h1>Blog#5</h1>
			<p>  Another week on Cocademy! Last week I start to learn an easy way to set the format of the words, the style or color. Usually I have to style the code each time in the <>. Nevertheless, now, I can use CSS to help me to realize them quickly. It’s easier to unify the whole page. It’s will be better!</p>
			<h1>Blog#6</h1>
			<p>  We won in the Big Ten again! And it reminds me my high school PE teacher. In his class, we are divided into 6groups with 7 people in each group. Every time he finishes his lesson, we’ll have a competition. The composition of our group isn’t quit idealistic. We have chatty person that not following the orders all the time; we have plump person that isn’t good at sports; we have less boys than other groups. I still remember that the first game we had is Frisbee. In this game our goal is just not get the last price, cause there’s only 4groups in our team. Surprisingly, we won the second price. Our second chance is the concert competition. We spent a whole week to practice and create our own style of dancing. In order to energize our whole team, we even set up a funny cheer action. When our team get nervous, we cheer up and encourage them. Guess what? We get a bonus price for the team spirit. I really miss u, Mr. Schmitt.</p>
			<h1>Blog#7</h1>
			<p> This week I decided where to go in my winter vacation. How exciting it is! In the first, I want to go to New York City since that’s a such prosperous city. However, one of the reason is it’s too expensive to stay for a whole vacation, secondly, I planned to go there on Thanksgiving Holiday. Thus, I decided to go to Orlando. I searched the Internet for Disney, Universal Studio, the places I used to daydreaming about since I was a child. I am really looking forward exploring the world of Harry Potter, tasting the Butter beer, eating those candies. Hopefully, I’ll have a great, unforgettable holiday in Orlando. </p>
			<h1>Blog#8</h1>
			<p>  This week I had my longest essay writing. Literally I mean, the longest, ever. Since it contains so many facts of the concept, I should write with quotes, evidences and data as much as possible to explain the concepts as clear as possible. Hopefully, teacher will like my essay. After this draft, I should start final editing day by day. Never be the last minute person!</p>
			<h1>Blog#9</h1>
			<p>  Today’s class we watched a documentary. It’s really attractive to me, since I am always in loved with ancient culture and cure. In China, I have read some of the books in those areas. It’s a good chance for me to learn more and practice my English listening skill. In the documentary, it even mentioned our Chinese’s cure system and superstition. As a Chinese I am really proud of myself and the country. After that, our remix group gathered together and finished the proposal. Hopefully, we can have a pleasant time together and produce a well-organized film.
</p>
			<h1>Blog#10</h1>
			<p>  It’s Thanksgiving and my first holiday in US. This thanksgiving holiday, I went to New York City, the biggest city in the United States and the economic center of the world. Although I’d heard that how prosperous New York City was, I was still shocked when I actually was there. As an international person, the place that gave me the deepest impression was Chinatown. In Chinatown, I ate the most traditional Chinese food in the US and bought a lot of traditional Chinese stuff. Those all reminded me of China, my hometown. Although the weather was cold those days, speaking Chinese with Chinese people made me feel warm. Beside Chinatown, I also went to Times Square, the Empire State building, the Grand Central, the Statue of Liberty, and couple of museums. New York City, the international city, attracts me all the time and I wish I could be there again if I had any chance.</p>
			<h1>Blog#11</h1>
			<p>   I start to editing the film for our remix project. Since none of my group member know the skill, I decided to edit by myself. The work can be measure as hours and hours. Post editing cost me so many hours, so that I didn’t even have the courage to face the inappropriate units. As long as I change an element in the film, my “ancient” computer may have nothing in response to me. It was really annoying. I thought it’s time to have a new computer. lol Anyway, I finished the film. Hopefully you guys can enjoy it.</p>
			<h1>Blog#12</h1>
			<p>   The last week of this semester!! Time has gone so quick that I didn’t even noticed. I felt like I’ve just went back from New York after thanksgiving. After a short week of study, I’ll going to have my final exams. I am really kind of worry about my EC course. Wish myself good luck on the exams. And all of you will have a great holiday!</p>
