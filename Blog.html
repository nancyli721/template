			<p> The presenter of this video posted this video in order to state one of his beliefs through a five-year letter to his dear uncle: everything will get better and be fulfilled with hope as time passed and live actively. In the beginning of the video, there are words pictured from blackboard to generally summarize the intimate links between the presenter and his uncle. Through the speech, his main purpose was to mourn his uncle. Basically, it’s a letter to his uncle. Besides that, in the first part of the letter, the presenter introduced both his and his uncle’s paths, narrating his essential events happened on him. Afterwards, he expressed his tremendous painful feeling when he had to face his uncle’s sudden death. It was more like a reflection of himself, on his deep admiration to uncle and his helplessness when he was alone. However, “it gets better”. For the last part of the speech, audience are told that after few years of teaching, sinking in literature and philosophy and normal life time, things get better. He tried to express the belief that keep living and trying, everything will get better and fulfil with hope. </p>
			<p> The video attempts to achieve the purpose mainly through pathos. The voice and tone, the expression ways and the choice of words, a bunch of rhetoric methods all support the emotional appeal. First of all, through the speech, his voice changed from calm to arousing, even choke, every now and then. It helped to agitate audience’s mood. Besides that, the presenter chose vivid and concrete language and words. He utilized a bunch of figurative words that are emotionally charged to describe his precise feeling in great detail. Moreover, the parallel construction of a series of synonyms likes bullets shooting on you. And the rhetoric questions made a great emotional impact which engage audience to be connected and agreed with his main propose as well. </p>
			<p> Through this video, the concrete structure shows that a good structure helps to connect readers with the words. In order to engage their attention, I need to be careful on choosing vivid words and figurative language to actually show my experience instead of describing them. Because this essay ought to need clear logical relation, I need to pay more attention on the consecution of the whole story line to improve my essay. </p>
