			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>I am aiming to join in the BCC College, business apartment of MSU, so I decided to choose the financial topic relating to my major- product positioning and designing. In the modern world, online- shopping in the supermarket, drugstore, there are tons of products can make you faint. So what makes to choose the product or even be loyal to that brand? The answers are services, taste, functions, convenience, or just luck? The intuition of clients can't be operated by the company or the producer. However, the producer can make customers keep eyes on the product at higher possibility through adding several extraordinary properties. Even to persuade them to be frequent callers of the product. These are the problems producers should think about before releasing the product. That comes the term: Product positioning. </p>
			<p>What the term Positioning means? Positioning is a concept in marketing which was first introduced by Jack Trout ("Industrial Marketing" Magazine- June/1969) and then popularized by Al Ries and Jack Trout in their bestseller book "Positioning - The Battle for Your Mind." (McGraw-Hill 1981) In short, "Product positioning" is a marketing technique intended to present products in the best possible light to different target audiences. (http://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/product-positioning.html) "Positioning is also defined as the way by which the marketers attempt to create a distinct impression in the customer's mind."</p>
			<p>After searching the website, I found two articles: a scholar journal and a website news article on the latest product: iPhone, which links to my project. I also interview Professor Martin in Business major and we discuss about the concept of product positioning and make links to economics. Use graphs and data to interpret the probable results of a commercial decision. A well-explained example and numerous suggestions to producers would provide as well in the last part of the essay.</p>
