			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p> For more extension, why women would have such significant changes? Women may appreciate to the promotion of self-awareness and those non-government organizations. At the beginning, those initiative women leaders held a conference to have the first step of changing the future in the 19th century. Back to the example of Calkins, as mentioned before, she was firstly denied by Harvard University, though she had finished all the requirements, and was sent to Radcliffe College. At last, she refused the unequal treatment and refused the degree. Nevertheless, she moved on and became a distinguish researcher and the first female president of APA (American Psychological Association) in 1905. It can be told from the example, in which single woman did not want to be treated unfairly; even she can’t get the PHD. </p>
			<p>Moreover, Madam Hillary actually speaks out for women rights in the speech. At the time whn she was caught into a trouble of women, she argued forcefully against the practices that abused women around the world. “That it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights. If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all."[5] It possible to change one ethnical thought unless you noticed the right way, the way it should be. The change position of women all indicates that nowadays, women’s self recognitions have been raised. They notice clearly that they need to fight for themselves. </p>
			<p> Last but not least, in my point of view, women rights are essential to our everyday living. It has attracted so much attention from the society, but not fair enough. In developing and backward countries, like Africa, men are still performing the King at home. There are researches show that “Over 1 million more female babies who died each year than the male do because of neglecting and abuses.” How can we treat those inequities? From interior and exterior, there’s far more stuff we should and can do to rescue those people. Firstly, help the poor counties with both money and technology. Modern technology would affect the productive industries, so that some work can be provided to women. More work opportunities can be divided between men and women. Also, education level is vital as well. Without education, even though they have jobs currently, based on the rapid development of the society, women would be thrown to the lower classes again, as burdens. Women can’t accept the discrimination as their fate again. Moreover, the mass media is one of the infusive ways to improve social awareness, like the film “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind” by Miyazaki. It mainly painted a girl with strong power who clearly realizes her responsibility. She did not retreat because she is a woman. In short, being educated for improving self-awareness and using modern technology to provide jobs to ensure they can have their position in the society, as well as attract world’s attention through the mass media.</p>
