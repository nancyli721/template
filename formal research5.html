			<h1>Exposing the side effect</h1>
			<p> Besides that, don't afraid to exposure the side effects of the product. Another aspect should be considered and announced to the customers is the side effects of the product.  "For instance, two of the most common side effects are an increase in tooth sensitivity to hot and cold items. Although less common, other side effects that have been reported are: sore throat, tooth pain, tingling of the tissues, and headaches." (Arora, 2006) On one hand, it shows the honesty of the company. After all, beyond the whole market, in the long term, the reputation of the company value more than the profits of the specified item. Producers should have long-term vision, instead of just focus on immediate interests. They can survive until the government or customers figure out the truth. As a common knowledge, we cannot swathe flames in paper. On the other hand, based on the researches in the paper, the author suggested that it tends to have a larger market if the producer mentioned the side effects, because consumers may have less uncertainty when they use the product. </p>
			<p> An important question is the following: What is the impact of such disclosures on consumer preferences for the products? There are several surveys in journal to conclude the effects. First is that the females were more likely to use label information than males. Second thesis was exposed by the random experiments. "Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: warning label (e.g. "In this product, 90% of the calories come from fat. Warning: The US Surgeon General has determined that eating high fat food increases your risk of heart disease."), information label (e.g. "In this product, 90% of the calories come from fat."), and no label."  So the result reveals that the subjects in the warning- and no-label groups wanted to taste, but were less likely to eat the full-fat product than those in the no-label group." (Arora, 2006)</p>
			<p> If you are wondering about the great example of how to announce the effect of a product, the following paragraph would be a suitable model. "According to the statement: Accumulated clinical data on neutral pH 10 percent carbamide peroxide continue to support both the safety and effectiveness of this kind of tooth whitening agent. The most commonly observed side effects of hydrogen or carbamide peroxide are tooth sensitivity and occasional irritation of the soft tissues in the mouth (oral mucosa), particularly the gums. Tooth sensitivity often occurs during early stages of bleaching treatment. Tissue irritation, in most cases, results from an ill-fitting tray rather than the tooth-bleaching agents. Both of these conditions usually are temporary and stop after the treatment (see www.ada.org/prof/resources/positions/statements/whiten2. asp)."  (Arora, 2006)</p>
