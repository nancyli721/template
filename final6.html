			     <h1>Remix Project</h1>
			     
				 <p>What’s more about literacy? Remix! That is a remix project which is defined as multi-media plus memo writing. Have you ever endure enough that there would be endless number of long essay during the term? Since this the Writing class with the core topic of Technology, our professor would definitely lead you explore the fancy world of computer science and multi-media. You not only have to learn about the “Cocademy”, which is incredible that teach you how to create your own website form of personal portfolio, but also would sign you the project of Remix project. What you should do is to use any kind of media.</p>
                 <p>To begin with Cocademy, it’s an excellent website that actually can teach you how to write your own html files. What you see on the websites, or Facebook, or Twitter, don’t be jealous, you can do that by yourself, just by “github” and this web tutorial. However, it’s a long tutorial would cost you lots of time if you want attractive websites as return. Thus, you should study and learn to code ahead, week by week. Don’t back up the voluminous course until the last minute. That would be tremendous of works to learn and remember. If you follow the instructions step by step, you’ll be fall in love with it. Personally, I always couldn’t wait to add what I just had learned to the profile. After syncing, the moment I refresh the website and showed what I got was perfect was so breathtaking and satisfied that I was even proud of myself. After the whole semester, your well-organized website is primed to show the professor your effort through the term. </p>
				 <p>Furthermore, the other unique strategy you could have a chance to learn about is film-making. It would be a group project which measures your organization skills, collaboration, and leadership. Know by heart that group communication would be the hinge through the project. In about two to three weeks, you’ll have to determine the topic, the way to show the theme, the setting and climax of the storyline, as well as the post production processes in the first. Then as a group, with concisely planned and arrangements, hopefully you will all produce amazing commercials or documentary YouTube videos. Furthermore, you should record all the difficulties and solutions through the experience in the form of a “Memo”. Be careful with the instructions and requirements, and good luck.</p>
