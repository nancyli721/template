			<h1>Examples and application to life</h1>
			<p> In the second part, there will be a few examples that can help the readers get the idea of how a profitable product pre-positioning works in the market. What's more, "The findings indicate that the brand name is more important for search goods, especially prior to product trial. They conclude that prior to trial, brand name increases consumers' perception of experience and credence attribute performance evaluations." (Arora, 2006) For instance, the cosmetic products are the perfect example of product positioning. Consideration of the brands like channel, YSL, Lancôme comparing to E.L.F. and L'Oreal. Lancôme and L'Oreal belong to the same company, but why they need two separate brands? In the following essay, there would have answers.</p>
			<p> Linking to the public article I found, there would be the example of the latest social event: the publishing of iphone 5s and 5c. Why there would be two versions of the product. What are the target consumers of the product? Form the concepts listed in the previous essay, readers can notice the strategies. We can find the reason by locating the exact differences between 5s and 5c. The price, pretty obvious, the color, the property, and the hardware are all atypical. 5c is facing low-end market and 5s is facing to apple fans and high-end market. "Apple needs new customers to keep growing, and the 5C was supposed to appeal to a new, more price-conscious consumer," (Gross, 2008) Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst with Forrester Research, said. " Turns out that the acquisition is a lot harder than retention." The combination of 5s and 5c can have a larger range of target consumers. Consumers who purchase the 5c may think of the affordable price of 5c, and the colorful outfit, which is completely different from the classic black and white old iPhones. Thus, it's pretty obvious that 5c and 5s are designed for those consumers who may be able to afford the 5s, or who want bright color for their phones. "Apple has more work to do to attract the next generation of iPhone customers," (Gross, 2008) Epps said. "The 5C isn't resonating as Apple hoped it would."
