			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>First of all is education level. In the past, women received barely any education. They are uncultured, thus they can’t work or vote. Yet, the situation changed. Girls and boys can be taught at the same time. In their rest of lives, knowledge is the key to own a job. In this way, they bumped into a variety of fields, get rid of the unfair fortune and have a better, free life by themselves. However, it’s just a beginning of being instructed. Even in the professional field of psychology, authorities still did not admit women scientists. In 1890, Calkins, a female scholar in the field of psychology, though has finished all the PhD’s requirements, still did not get the recognition from Harvard University. Instead, she was transferred to a small college. This example shows that though the society allowed women to be educated, some of the women still cannot be fully admitted. After all, that’s in the first period of the feminist movement. As time goes through, the policies widen towards more women citizens in developed countries. By 1998, women earned a majority, a proportion of 56%, of all associate and bachelor degrees. (U.S. National Center for Education Statistics, 2001). This proves that women in each professional field were rising steadily. </p>
			<p> One of the other most significantly change is diversity of the labor force. More and more works are provided for women, especially jobs like nurses or teachers. When there are wars, women are the best resources. From then on, women and men can have the equal amount of payment and work permission, except for unique works that are more suitable for men. In world war two, Canadian women were signed up as logistics members even nurse in order to back up the lack of people. Besides that, the time they can work also increased. Temporary workers are transferred to permanent office workers, as well as married women. In this such improvement, the fair gender equality in the labor force not only can benefit women, but also provide the society with diverse labor forces.</p>
			<p> Last but not least, the greatest step for women is suffrage. Women are officially claimed that have rights to vote in 1920, after the 19th Amendment Constitution. That’s a great progress of identifying the social status of women in the society. Today, there are thousands of women serving leaderships of an association, a company, a college, a city, even a country. For instance, Hillary, wife of the former President Clinton, won 70% votes and she can continue to be the senator from New York City. Another solid example would be Yang Liu. She’s the first formal Chinese astronaut launched into space station with the Shenzhou 9th. All these data proved the promoted social status of women. And people pay much more attention on feminine occupation.</p>
