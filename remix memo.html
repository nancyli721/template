			<h1>Remix Memo</h1>
			<h1> Group: SHYZ</h1>
			<h1> Group member: Chenzhuo Li</h1>
			<p> REMIX PROJECT ASSESSMENT MEMO</p>
			<h1> Composing in Context </h1>
			<p>   </p>
			<p>   Our group’s main purpose is to show the audience how literacy and research online can help us. Our group decided to present the whole concept by small interviews. The informational conversation between the host and these students can show the audience what they actually got in the last project. </p>
			<p> All in one, our group presented the whole concept in interview format. Through the form of question and answer, audience can know what they are talking and the specific field in the different topics. And the settings of the students in the interviews were all haven’t taken the professional course at MSU yet. Thus, compare to that information presented by students who have learned a few years in their major, our group’s information is more convince to show how an overwhelmed research could help students. </p>
			<p> Moreover, we insert a documentary and a picture drawn by Professor Martin to help showing the concepts. Firstly, they made the video to have multi-typed information, and hopefully it could make more sense to audiences. </p>
			<p> Overall, our group presented each students interview in logical order. We shrink the whole business field into 3 parts: backstage calculation, product positioning and public service. The common questions about each subject should be introduction, key parts and their personal suggestions to the audience. Mainly, the introduction and key parts can give the audience a whole concept of the subject. Then, their personal analyzes not only can go into the concepts more thoroughly, but also can show how they have improved after researches. Basically, among the whole video, the audience can just participate with the presenters as audience, watching what they got.</p>
			<p>   </p>
			<h1> Process </h1>
			<p>   </p>
			<p> In the first part of discussion, since most of the group members are not humor enough, so we may be short at acting. So we think that the formal research paper is more suitable for us, technically. What’s more, we decided our group’s name as “SHYZ”- same pronounce as “SHYS”, which means a group of shy people. Furthermore, SHYA are the first initial from our members’ names. We thought that would be meaningful and we all like it.  </p>
			<p> Furthermore, the most challenging part for our group is how we can present the concepts in an attractive way. As a group leader, I actually lead my team members to practice and practice about the accent and the body language over the screen. In about 5 hours, we finished filming. It’s really tough but worth it. Firstly we look through team member’s essay and find out the information and summarize the essays. Look through the summaries; we came out the idea of introduction to Business field and the remaining questions for our interviews. </p>
			<p> Last but not least, we gathered together as a whole and came out the four points that can be great suggestions of the viewers. And we performed the ending together to add dramatic effects to the video. Hope viewers can enjoy. </p>
			<p>   </p>
			<h1> Research </h1>
			<p>   </p>
			<p> In the process of writing and research on the essay, those Scholarly journals should be the most helpful material for my project. They are commonly written by those people called “experts”, who are professional in their fields. What are presented in the journals is more convinced than other information over the internet and magazines. However, for this academic research, commercials are not helpful enough. They are too subjective because they intend to sell their product. In this way, their opinions are not really reliable. </p>
			<p>   </p>
			<h1> Collaboration , Project Management , Documentary Design  </h1>
			<p>   </p>
			<p> Though we are in different majors, but we find the relation between our majors: Business. Working in group helps a lot because your group members may tell you something you have never thought of or figure out your mistakes that you did not notice. Working as a team could know my advantage and weakness.  </p>
			<p> Personally, I think my team had a great time together. No one had complained about the long time we took while filming. When everything was done, we made the video that you see now eventually. I may make it more interesting. A great project should be kind of humorous, so that audience won’t fall asleep. In this way will it be able to attract more audience. In my perspective, the remix we did is pretty good, but not really attractive enough. “SHYZ” need more time to practice acting skills. That’s a disadvantage for our group. </p>
			<p> We mix a lot of knowledge from different fields: statistics, marketing, and hospitality. Somehow we linked them together as the sub-field of Business. The combination of the knowledge we got from researching is more convinced. We actually have changed our theme quite a few times. Finally we made the deal of this theme: The benefit of formal research and literacy.  </p>
