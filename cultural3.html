			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>  --- A young girl stands on a giant worm, receiving all the applauses from the residents in the valley. It is the last scenery of “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind”. Nausica, a young princess of the Valley of the wind, shows her passion for nature, courageous and power towards disasters, and her strong mind through the battle to protect her community. “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind” was released in 1984 and received high recommendations. Not surprisingly, the director Miyazaki Hayao has been called a feminist. Besides the film “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind”, the major of main characters in Miyazaki’s films are female. “Women are every bit as likely to be heroes as men, every bit as likely to be in positions of power – and the majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are well-characterized women.” [3] Currently, film are not only a tool to make up some images or hilarious plots or realize the scenes which can’t be produced in real lives, but also a medium used to show up negative social influences which leads viewers to rumination. Tons and tons of directors tend to use movie or animation as such tools. Among them, Miyazaki Hayao is one of the most successful and influential directors. What make them extraordinary are the resolute female protagonists. “Miyazaki's many heroines have some exceptional potential as feminist figures in ways that Western leading ladies often don't.”[1] Why there are such huge amounts of media intend to eulogize women? These characters cause the people's cognition and thinking to feminism. Comparing to the women status decades years ago, women in the past were just baby-sitting at home and had no rights to be a people in the social.  </p>
