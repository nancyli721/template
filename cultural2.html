			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>“Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include, though are not limited to, the right: to bodily integrity and autonomy; to vote (suffrage); to hold public office; to work; to fair wages or equal pay; to own property; to education; to serve in the military or be conscripted; to enter into legal contracts; and to have marital or parental rights.” (Lockwood) [2] Why women should be locked at home and stared at the squared sky all day long and take care of the children? What’s more, they have barely any political rights that allowed them to fight against the unfair policies. Comparing to the whole society nowadays, it should be the dream world of those aforementioned women residents. Now, girls are educated at the same time with the boys. A woman is found in the news of Chinese spaceman. Moreover, women can vote in the political events! However, Hillary still spoke out for women rights recently…So are women rights being promoted or remaining the same comparing to the status they were 50years ago?</p>
