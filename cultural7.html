			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, from the past decades of year, the status of women of the society has been promoted a lot from vary aspects. Initially, women’s own opinion and recognition transfer from a willing to self-defense, no one can administrate themselves. That makes women’s life both material and spiritual balanced. After that, the foundation conferences and declarations from all over the world assist them to achieve their will: be dependent and gain equal right. Women in high education level, variety gender in the labor force and female leadership can all prove that as evidences. We want a peaceful world without mutation, discrimination or rapes. </p>
			<p>However, that’s frequent in prosperous countries. Some backward countries deserve our more attention and help. Hopefully, in exterior, developed countries and passionate people throughout the world can subsidize money for providing more work opportunities and education institutions. And in interior, women, all the women, should fortify our self-awareness and endeavor, unless we want an unfair life.</p>
