			<h1>Investigation</h1>
			<p>  To extend, the whole process of the project positioning should consider the follow conditions. First of all, at the beginning of producing or having the willing to sell the product, the company or the producers should know their target customers' preferences. A product should be designed5 based on target customers. It can show that the quantity, the price level, and the location of the market. For example, as for a company which produces wool and cotton, it's pretty obvious that they may have a smaller market in tropical countries comparing to those countries along the Arctic Circle. And along the Arctic Circle, developing countries prefer lower price than developed countries. Besides that, considering to how could the country would be in the winter, the shape, the style of scarves may also be altered to suit for various countries' consumers. That's what understanding your customers thoroughly mean. If a company is powerful enough to enlarge their market to the whole world to satisfy more and more people, they can certainly produce specific products based on investigation. However, for less powerful companies, they need to get to know customers, in other words, find their potential market, to determine the price level, and the basic functions of the product. </p>
		    <p> Furthermore, "in a growing or mature market these characteristics become even more important in differentiating these competitive products." which means that what kind of extra attributes should be stressed in positioning a product. (Arora, 2006) For example, should the company make the teeth whitening product simple to use? Or "Which attributes should be stressed in positioning a product?" (Arora, 2006) the product will be released into a viable market. It is producer's responsibility to consider the specialties of the product which make consumers choose this product rather than other products in other countries. For instance, Apple products had their own operate systems for either cell phones or computers. In the early of publishing of iPhone, how Mr. Forbes knew for sure that such new system could be accepted in the market. After all, people were quite get used into Windows System. They didn't have to take that much risk to study a new system which would make them to consider about compatibility, which is more complicated than the previous "old system". They were confident enough to sell those new systemic products as they add features in the product so that can make more profits than the cost of learning a new system. It's more stable, easier operation. Linking to other fields of the market, that's one of the reasons why people never stop invention or updating the products. </p>
			<p> Through the interview with Professor Martin, he pointed out that usually a product with new functions or elements which cause producer more opportunity cost can win more demands, so that the profits could be far more than the costs. For instance, an easy-going example could be the design of frames of the glasses. Year ago, glasses were just for shortsighted or farsighted patients. Surprisingly, they have been changed from colorful and multi-shaped to ultraviolet prevented or even able to change color automatically. Materials for frames are countless. Silver, gold, woods, alloy, etc. Moreover, the shape and combination of color on the frame are the definition to "Fashion" in the modern world. Consumers tend to spend a little more money on a pair of glasses that can make them stand out rather than a mediocre frame with nothing special. Thus, it's the opportunity for producers to earn more. Another way to say is shifting the demand curve. See the graph below:</p>
			<p> What the graph shows is basically the relationship between demand and supply. The x-axis is the quantity, and the y-axis is the price. In the example of yellow framed glasses: It costs producers some price to produce the yellow framed products, however, it actually increases a lot demand in the market. Thus, the demand curve would shift to right, which means more quantities are sold. The distance of the movement of the curves proves that a little change may lead to a large amount of products be sold in the market. </p>
		    <p> In short, producers can make much more profit by adding unique attributes to certain products. It would be even better to take over the market. At the meantime, it should be based on the potential market, which they ought to studies forehead.
However, distinctive elements of the product can be either functional or fashionable. Luxuries are the best example of this branch. The blaze new trails of the bowknot on Gucci bags give them the symbol of the brand and the brand's peculiar fashion so that loyal customers would pay thousands of dollars for a bag. People always tend to choose the better one, the prettier one. So it's usually good to add utilities or decorations on to the product to increase the demand.
